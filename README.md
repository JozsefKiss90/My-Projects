##  Hello there,

My name is Jozsef Kiss and I am a self thaught web-developer from hungary. I started programming in the spring of 2021 and have done several projects since then. My first one was a virtual laboratory to conduct online psychological experiments for benchmarking e-sport players. The next one was a webshop where I planned to sell paintings, that I started to write in php and JS. However my buisness model wasn't right and realized that React would be a better solution for implementation so I created a new one. Now I'm working on new experiments.
